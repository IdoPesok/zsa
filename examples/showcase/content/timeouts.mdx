# Timeouts

When you need to limit the execution time of a server action, you can configure a `timeout` (in milliseconds). If the action runs longer than the specified timeout, it will throw a `SAWError`.

## Timeouts on Actions

To set a timeout on an individual action, use the `timeout` method:

```typescript:actions.ts
"use server"
import { createServerActionWrapper } from "server-actions-wrapper"
import z from "zod"

export const helloWorldAction = createServerActionWrapper()
  .createAction()
  .input(z.object({ message: z.string() }))
  .timeout(1000) // Set the timeout to 1000ms (1 second)
  .handler(async ({ input }) => {
    // Simulating a random execution time between 0 and 2 seconds
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000 * Math.random()))
    return input.message
  })
```

In this example, if the `helloWorldAction` takes more than 1 second to complete, it will throw a `SAWError`.

## Timeouts on Procedures

You can also set a timeout on a procedure to apply it to all actions that use that procedure:

```typescript:actions.ts
"use server"

const protectedProcedure = createServerActionProcedure()
  .timeout(1000) // Set the timeout to 1000ms (1 second)
  .noInputHandler(async () => {
    try {
      const { email, userId } = await getUserId();
      return {
        user: {
          email,
          userId,
        }
      }
    } catch {
      throw new Error("UNAUTHORIZED")
    }
  })

const protectedActionMiddleware = createServerActionWrapper().procedure(protectedProcedure)

export const exampleAction = protectedActionMiddleware.createAction()...
```

In this case, all actions using the `protectedProcedure` will have a timeout of 1 second.

## Timeout precedence

If a timeout is configured on both a procedure and an action that uses that procedure, the action's timeout will take precedence and overwrite the procedure's timeout.

For example, if `protectedProcedure` has a timeout of 1000ms and `exampleAction` has a timeout of 500ms, the effective timeout for `exampleAction` will be 500ms.

By utilizing timeouts, you can prevent server actions from running indefinitely and ensure that your application remains responsive. This is particularly useful when dealing with external APIs or long-running computations that might exceed acceptable response times.
