# Introduction

`server-actions-wrapper` is the best DX for building typesafe, validated server actions in NextJS.
Inspired from the popular libraries like tRPC, `server-actions-wrapper` is designed to be a lightweight solution to allow developers to integrate server actions throughout their NextJS project with a clean, scalable DX.

To get started, you can install `server-actions-wrapper` using npm:

```bash:terminal
npm i server-actions-wrapper zod
```

  [Zod](https://zod.dev/) provides a simple way to define and validate types in
  your code.
