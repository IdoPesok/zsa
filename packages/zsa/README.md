### Future Updates

#### Next.js 15 Compatibility
At this time, this project does not support **Next.js 15**, and I likely won‚Äôt have the bandwidth to make the necessary updates myself. If this is a feature you‚Äôd like to see, contributions are highly encouraged! 

If you‚Äôre interested in helping:
- Please feel free to open a Pull Request (PR) with the required updates.
- I‚Äôll do my best to review and merge PRs as time allows.

#### Open Source ‚Äì Fork or Maintain
This project is open source, so feel free to fork it, modify it, or use it however you like! If you‚Äôre interested in taking on a more active role as a maintainer, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ping me.

#### Recommended Alternatives
For those seeking a library that already supports **Next.js 15**, I recommend checking out [**next-safe-action**](https://next-safe-action.dev/). It offers excellent compatibility and features for safe server actions in Next.js.

#### Long-Term Outlook
While I can‚Äôt promise regular updates to this project moving forward, I hope it can still serve as a useful resource for those interested. Thanks for your understanding and support! üôè
